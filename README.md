**Enhancing Market Efficiency through Predictive Ratings**

**Overview**

This project delves into the Colombian business landscape to refine business rating predictions using machine learning techniques. By analyzing a dataset of 294,462 businesses, we aim to bridge the gap between actual and predicted ratings, enhancing consumer decision-making processes.

**Methodology**

We start with Logistic Regression and Random Forest models, acknowledging their limitations, and progress to a custom-built multi-input deep learning model. This model, designed with TensorFlow's Keras API, excels in processing diverse customer review data.

**Results**

Initial models achieved accuracies of 0.69 (Logistic Regression) and 0.71 (Random Forest). Our deep learning model is tailored to surpass these by capturing complex data relationships.

**Contributions**

This study highlights deep learning's potential in predictive rating systems, emphasizing feature engineering's importance and model selection based on dataset specifics. It offers businesses a comprehensive framework to leverage customer reviews for improved service quality and market positioning.

**Usage**

Data analysis includes TF-IDF for text data and creative feature engineering.
Model evaluation involves splitting data, fitting models, and assessing accuracy through comparison.

**Conclusion**

Our findings underscore the effectiveness of advanced machine learning models in predictive analytics for ratings, providing a nuanced approach to understanding consumer feedback and business attributes in the digital marketplace.
